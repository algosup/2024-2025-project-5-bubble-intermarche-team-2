# Test Cases

## Purpose

This document outlines the various test cases that will be executed to ensure the functionality and reliability of the system. Each test case includes a description, expected outcome, and actual outcome.

## Criticality Levels

There are three criticality levels for the test cases:

| Criticality Level | Color Code | Description                                                                              |
| ----------------- | ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| High              | Red        | Critical functionality that must work for the system to be operational.                  |
| Medium            | Yellow     | Important functionality that should work but is not critical for the system's operation. |
| Low               | Green      | Non-critical functionality that is nice to have but not essential.                       |

## Categories

Each test case is categorized into one of the following categories:

| Category      | Description                                                                |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Functional    | Tests that verify the system performs its intended functions.              |
| Performance   | Tests that assess the system's performance under various conditions.       |
| Usability     | Tests that check the user interface and user experience.                   |
| Compatibility | Tests that ensure the system works across different platforms and devices. |
| Regression    | Tests that verify that new changes do not break existing functionality.    |
| Integration   | Tests that check the interaction between different system components.      |
