# Test Cases

## Purpose

This document outlines the various test cases that will be executed to ensure the functionality and reliability of the system. Each test case includes a description, expected outcome, and actual outcome.

## Criticality Levels

There are three criticality levels for the test cases:

| Criticality Level | Color Code | Description                                                                              |
| ----------------- | ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| High              | Red        | Critical functionality that must work for the system to be operational.                  |
| Medium            | Yellow     | Important functionality that should work but is not critical for the system's operation. |
| Low               | Green      | Non-critical functionality that is nice to have but not essential.                       |
