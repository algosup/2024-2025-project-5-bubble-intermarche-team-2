# Project Charter

## Project Definition
---

Intermarché Saint-Rémy-de-Provence, our client, wants an application to promote their wines and cheeses. As the area attracts many tourists, they also want a multi-language app. To achieve this we will make an application using [bubble](https://bubble.io/home/apps) (no code software).

This project is initiated by an external company; the client is Intermarché Saint-Rémy-de-Provence. Communication with the client will be managed by our Program Manager, Matéo Lefin.

## Project Plan
---

On April 25th, 2025, after the first meeting with the clients to initialize the project, we held a brainstorming session to develop ideas, understand what is mandatory, nice to have, and needs to be avoided for the application.

Communication with the client will primarily be through email. However, meetings may be scheduled as needed for clarity on specific issues.

We have chosen a Waterfall project management approach, supplemented by elements of Scrum and Agile testing. This hybrid approach is due to limited available working hours, yet it allows for flexibility in testing and iterative improvements.

Tasks and objectives will be outlined based on the components required for an application. These tasks will be prioritized according to their significance and assigned to team members to ensure efficient completion. A detailed project schedule and task assignment can be found in the external spreadsheet [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uLIzS4_YxH9-CVMZtKXqUARc0P42ZEMt2gEQdO4M388/edit?usp=sharing)

Upon project completion, a post-mortem analysis will be conducted after the final presentation on June 20th, 2025, to evaluate performance and document lessons learned for the client.

## Risks
---

| Risk Type | Description | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
| --------- | ----------- | ---------- | ------ | ------------------- |
| Misinterpretation of Requirements | Key requirements may be misunderstood or omitted.                                            | Medium | High | Regular client communication and clarification meetings.   |
| Unengaging Application Design     | The application might be intuitive and user-friendly but fail to be attractive for users.    | Low    | High | Frequent testing with non-team members to gather feedback. |
| Overconfidence in Scope           | The project scope may exceed the available time and resources.                               | Medium | High | Start small and expand iteratively based on progress.      |
| Attachment to the Product         | Team members may become too attached to features that do not align with client requirements. | Low    | High | Be open to pivoting and adapting to client feedback.       |
