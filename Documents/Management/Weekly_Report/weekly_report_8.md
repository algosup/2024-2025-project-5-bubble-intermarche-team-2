# Weekly Report - Week 8

---

## Overview

---

We had so much advance we started our presentation for the next week, but we had the bad news of one person in the team leaving the school so we don't have a user manual for this project.

## Accomplishments

---

1. **Document**
   - Weekly report 7 + review.
   - Update WBS, KPIs, Actual schedule.
2. **Code**
   - Fix some minor bugs.
   - Spelling and grammar check.

## Challenges

---

1. **One member leave the school**
    - Our technical writer left the school so for the deadline of the user manual we don't have one, because he did only the skeleton.
2. **Remote calling about confusion for the oral**
   - Because we had confusion between who speak first between tests and challenges & solutions categories we did a call with the quality assurance absent because he was passing an exam.

## Plan for Next Week

---

Prepare oral presentation and pull request for management documents and the code.

## Conclusion

---

Despite losing a team member, we've made good progress on documentation updates and bug fixes. 
Our presentation preparation is on track, and we're committed to delivering a quality project despite the user manual setback. 
Next week, we'll focus on finalizing our presentation and preparing all deliverables for submission.
