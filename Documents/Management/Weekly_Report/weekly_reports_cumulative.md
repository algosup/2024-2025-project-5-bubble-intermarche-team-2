---

## Overview

---

This week, the writing of most of the documents, such as the functional, technical, and test plan skeletons, started.
On the development side, we started work on the application's front-end, but due to exams, we had to work more slowly than expected, so we reacted quickly and didn't fall behind on the project.

## Challenges

---

1. **Waiting validation**
   - As the program managers work together, they send their messages and questions in pairs, but the customer didn't respond to the validation of the mock-up, so that we couldn't go any further on the front-end.

## Plan for Next Week

---

1. **Documents**
   - Finish the functional specification.
   - Continue the technical specification.

## Conclusion

---

Despite the challenges posed by exams and delays in client feedback, our team remained committed and adaptable. 
We made solid progress on both documentation and development, ensuring the project stayed on track. 
By staying organized and responsive, we maintained our momentum and are well-prepared for the upcoming tasks.
