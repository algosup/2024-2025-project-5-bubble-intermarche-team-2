# Weekly Report - Week 3

---

## Overview

---

This week, the writing of most of the documents, such as the functional, technical, and test plan skeletons, started.
On the development side, we started work on the application's front-end, but due to exams, we had to work more slowly than expected, so we reacted quickly and didn't fall behind on the project.

## Accomplishments

---

1. **Documents**
   - 95% of the functional specifications are done (need to add schematics).
   - The technical specifications have started.
   - The skeleton of the test plan his finished.
   - Started the weekly report 3.
   - Updated the WBS and actual schedule, and started the KPIs spreadsheet.
2. **Development**
   - Updated the database to add the allergens category.
   - Started the front-end of the application.
3. **Reviews**
   - These different documents have been reviewed :
     - Weekly report 2.
     - First review of the functional.

## Challenges

---

1. **Waiting validation**
   - As the program managers work together, they send their messages and questions in pairs, but the customer didn't respond to the validation of the mock-up, so that we couldn't go any further on the front-end.

## Plan for Next Week

---

1. **Documents**
   - Finish the functional specification.
   - Continue the technical specification.
   - Write the weekly report 3 and 4, update the actual schedule, WBS, and finish KPIs.
   - Some reviews (weekly 3, functional), pursue the test plan and test cases.
2. **Development**
   - Continue the front-end if the client validates the mock-up; if not, update the database.
3. **Meeting**
   - Meet the wine expert of Vierzon to talk about our different ideas for the project and some associations we can make with wine.

## Conclusion

---

Despite the challenges posed by exams and delays in client feedback, our team remained committed and adaptable. We made solid progress on both documentation and development, ensuring the project stayed on track. By staying organized and responsive, we maintained our momentum and are well-prepared for the upcoming tasks.
