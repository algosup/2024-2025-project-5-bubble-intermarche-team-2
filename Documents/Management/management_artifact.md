## Key Performance Indicators

### Definition of our KPIs
---

To keep track of the project's advancement, KPIs have been defined. These KPIs are listed below in their respective categories, along with the reasoning behind each.

This section contains the following KPIs:

#### <ins>Documents</ins>
---

This section contains the following KPIs:

- **Functional Specifications**
- **Technical Specifications**
- **Test Plan**
- **User Manual**

The following formula measures the progress of these documents:

$$\text{percentage} = \left(\frac{\text{current number of sections}} {\text{total number of sections}}\right)\times{100}$$

Where:

- **current_number_of_sections**: The number of sections that are completely done.
- **total_number_of_sections**: The number of predefined sections in the document's outline, which may evolve.

#### <ins>Application</ins>
---

This section tracks the following KPIs:

- **First Prototype**
- **Second Prototype**
- **Final Product**

Each of these KPIs is based on sub-tasks and will use user feedback to be calculated:

$$\text{percentage} = \left(\frac{{\text{current number of features (mandatory + Nice to have) + user feedback adaptation}}} {\text{total features predefined}}\right)\times{100}$$

Where:

- **current_number_of_features**: The number of features that are fully implemented.
- **user_feedback_adaptation**: Feedback adaptations we get during the test phases between each prototype or product.
- **total_features_predefined**: The total number of features predefined during project analysis.

#### <ins>Test</ins>
---

This section contains only one KPI:

- **Test Cases**

The percentage progress is defined as follows:

$$\text{percentage} = \left(\frac{\text{number of tests performed}} {\text{total number of test cases}}\right)\times{100}$$

Where:

- **number_of_tests_performed**: The number of test cases performed.
- **total_number_of_test_cases**: The total number of test cases predefined.

#### <ins>Pitch</ins>
---

Only one KPI is included in this section:

- **Pitch Deck**

The percentage of completion is calculated using this formula:

$$\text{percentage} = \left(\frac{\text{current number of slides}} {\text{total number of slides}}\right)\times{100}$$

Where:

- **current_number_of_slides**: The number of slides currently designed in the Pitch Deck.
- **total_number_of_slides**: The number of slides the Pitch Deck should contain in the end.

#### <ins>Human Resources</ins>

The following KPIs are tracked in this section:

- **Overtime**
- **Unjustified Absence**

These KPIs are calculated only over 30 minutes each.

The overtime is tracked according to a [Google Form](#link-to-the-forms).

#### <ins>Mood</ins>

The mood percentage is calculated from the average of a 10-point personal grade. Each team member responds to a survey every week and gives their feelings about the week.

This method allows an accurate way of tracking the motivation and overall mood during the project.

You can find the responses [here](#link-to-the-forms).

## Addendum

### Differences Between Gantt Chart and Actual Schedule
---

The project schedule deviated from the initial Gantt chart due to several factors, which will be explained in this section.

Firstly, the design process was far more complicated and lengthy than I had planned. As a result, there were significant delays in other tasks since the design was essential for the entire project. To address this, we adopted a more iterative approach to creation, which explains the deviations from the original schedule.

Secondly, the test sessions took significantly more time than I had anticipated. Even by conducting some tests during our free time as overtime, we could not keep up with the original plan. Additionally, as the project manager, I did not allocate sufficient time for these tasks in the initial schedule. This contributed to delays in application development at certain points.

Finally, we had to scale back many of our initial ideas to deliver something playable and enjoyable by the end of the project. This explains why most tasks were nearly completed, except for the game application development, where not all the features we initially envisioned were implemented.

Overall, while some aspects of the project took longer than planned, we successfully delivered a playable game by the end of the project, which was the primary requirement set by our team.
